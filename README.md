@TODO
The below is for getting only the characters names
> The characters listed in wikipedia are all enclosed by an li tag. Most of them, I believe the most important ones, have their names enclosed by an a tag, as so for Hannah Abbott: 
    <li> â€“ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army#Hannah_Abbott" title="Dumbledore's Army">Hannah Abbott</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hufflepuff" class="mw-redirect" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> student in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter</a>'s year. Prefect and member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore's Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>.</li>
> However some of them don't have an a tag enclosing their names, which lead to the script collecting unwanted information.

> The characters pages arent standard, some of them have full pages, and some don't

> I'm trying to access only the characters with full dedicated pages, since that there is more information I can gather there
> So, RN I'm trying to create an if to access only those pages
